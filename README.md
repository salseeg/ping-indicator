# Ping-indicator

Ping-indicator is meant as a replacement for [link-monitor-applet](http://www.nongnu.org/link-monitor/) for Ubuntu.
It still has its rough edges and unimplemented parts, but does the job:

 -   pings given set of host names
 -   shows packet loss with solid red band
 -   monitors response time with logarithmic scale
 -   refreshes host IP (if DNS changed)
 -   has configurable ping interval

Star/Watch the project to encourage further improvements.

The latest .deb package is available at http://salseeg.github.io/ping-indicator/
