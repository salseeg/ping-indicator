A pure python ping implementation using raw sockets.

Note that ICMP messages can only be sent from processes running as root
(in Windows, you must run this script as 'Administrator').

== Revision history ==

==== Oct. 17, 2011 ====
* [[https://github.com/jedie/python-ping/pull/6|Bugfix if host is unknown]]

==== Oct. 12, 2011 ====
Merge sources and create a seperate github repository:
* https://github.com/jedie/python-ping

Add a simple CLI interface.

==== September 12, 2011 ====
Bugfixes + cleanup by Jens Diemer
Tested with Ubuntu + Windows 7

==== September 6, 2011 ====
[[http://www.falatic.com/index.php/39/pinging-with-python|Cleanup by Martin Falatic.]]
Restored lost comments and docs. Improved functionality: constant time between
pings, internal times consistently use milliseconds. Clarified annotations
(e.g., in the checksum routine). Using unsigned data in IP & ICMP header
pack/unpack unless otherwise necessary. Signal handling. Ping-style output
formatting and stats.

==== August 3, 2011 ====
Ported to py3k by Zach Ware. Mostly done by 2to3; also minor changes to
deal with bytes vs. string changes (no more ord() in checksum() because
>source_string< is actually bytes, added .encode() to data in
send_one_ping()).  That's about it.

==== March 11, 2010 ====
changes by Samuel Stauffer:
replaced time.clock with default_timer which is set to
time.clock on windows and time.time on other systems.

==== November 8, 2009 ====
Fixes by [[http://www.g-loaded.eu/2009/10/30/python-ping/|George Notaras]],
reported by [[http://cdhallman.blogspot.com|Chris Hallman]]: 

Improved compatibility with GNU/Linux systems.

Changes in this release:

Re-use time.time() instead of time.clock(). The 2007 implementation
worked only under Microsoft Windows. Failed on GNU/Linux.
time.clock() behaves differently under [[http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.clock|the two OSes]].

==== May 30, 2007 ====
little [[http://www.python-forum.de/post-69122.html#69122|rewrite by Jens Diemer]]:
 * change socket asterisk import to a normal import
 * replace time.time() with time.clock()
 * delete "return None" (or change to "return" only)
 * in checksum() rename "str" to "source_string"

==== December 4, 2000 ====
Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as
unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.

==== November 22, 1997 ====
Initial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess
what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only
put in what I need now.

==== December 16, 1997 ====
For some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when
this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under
Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the
bytes always and then do an htons().
